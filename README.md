You control a frog as they hurl themselves into space, going leaps and bounds beyond where any frog has leaped or bounded before!

TODO:
- Powerups?
- Game over and start screen
- Collisions
- More hazards
- Better sprites
- Sound
- Add more mechanics to do with the instability of the jetpack, related to the powerups?
